<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>
The <a href="<%= page_path(@conn, :index) %>">Limited Booster Generator</a> generates a number of booster for limited Magic the GatheringÂ® formats, such as <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/sealed-deck">Sealed</a> or <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft">Booster Draft</a>.
</p>

<h3>Where is the generator?</h3>
<p>
It is <a href="<%= page_path(@conn, :index) %>">right here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Do you expect me to type in all my cards by hand?</h3>
<p>
No. <a href="https://deckbox.org">Deckbox</a> offers an <i>Export to Text</i> feature that produces compatible lists.

There are also mobile apps such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/scryglass-magic-card-scanner/id1139485613">ScryGlass (for iOS)</a> that you can use to catalogue your cards.
</p>

<h3>Why did you build this?</h3>
<p>
Limited formats are fun. However, I don't want to buy a fresh pack of boosters everytime I want to draft with my friends. <a href="<%= page_path(@conn, :index) %>">Limited Booster Generator</a> offers a way to build boosters from the cards you already own.
</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>
The generator checks the rarity of each of your cards. It then takes 14 random cards for each booster. Each booster contains 10 commons, 3 uncommons and 1 rare (replaced by a mythic in about 1 in 8 boosters if available).
<br />
</p>

Rarity is determined by looking up the card name (english only) in a database based on <a href="https://mtgjson.com">MTG JSON</a>.

<h3>Can I contact you?</h3>

Of course! If you love or hate what I do or have something else to say, you can
